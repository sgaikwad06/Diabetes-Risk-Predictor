You can install these using pip

### Data Exploration :
The dataset used in this project is loaded from diabetes.csv. 
Initial exploration involves:
- Viewing the first few rows of the dataset.
- Checking for missing values and data types.
- Summarizing the dataset statistics.

### Data Preprocessing : 
In this step, we handle missing values, perform feature scaling, and prepare the data for model training.

### Model Building :
We explore multiple machine learning models to predict diabetes:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbour
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forests
5. Gradient Boosting
6. XGBoost
7. Support Vector Machine(SVM)

### Model Evaluation :
We evaluate the models based on several metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
Visualizations and performance metrics are provided to compare and understand the effectiveness of each model.

### Conclusion :
In this project, we analyzed health data to predict diabetes using machine learning. We explored various models like Logistic Regression and Random Forests, finding that Random Forests provided the best balance of accuracy and reliability. Our analysis highlighted the importance of data preparation and careful model evaluation. These insights help us understand the key factors that influence diabetes and improve prediction accuracy. This project lays the groundwork for more advanced studies and applications in healthcare predictions.
